Rules of Snake:
1. A snake can move up, down, left, or right; and its tail will follow
2. A snake cannot go in reverse
3. A snake can eat food to make its tail grow longer
4. A snake will die if it goes off the borders of the screen
5. A snake will die if it collides with any part of its body


*6/29/2018* : The snake is now being drawn on the screen and moving *almost* like it should. Currently, it can go in reverse but the tail follows the head as it should. The snake object is now comprised of a list of block objects
